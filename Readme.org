2. I have no clue on parenting (as of now)!
3. I don't want to leave this crucial topic for random unconscious forces of life.

This repo records my explorations and learnings of this crucial topic. The following picture summarizes the approach.
I don't want to go by hearsays or take things for granted, instead lets explore and learn!
