Last Saved: "Nov 29 Sun, 2020"

*** 2020-11-07 Sat | Welcome Notes!

1. By next Jan 2021 my baby boy will be one year old!
2. I have no clue on parenting (as of now)!
3. I don't want to leave this crucial topic for random unconscious forces of life.

This repo records my explorations and learnings of this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOqD0w5qRYI][crucial topic]]. The following picture summarizes the approach.
I don't want to go by hearsays or take things for granted, instead lets explore and learn!
