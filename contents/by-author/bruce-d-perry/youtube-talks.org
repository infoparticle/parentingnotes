** Take Aways

- small kids need more relational health (not more screen time/gadgets)
- relational health affects both physiology and psychology of kids.
- working parents, isolated homes moving away from traditional big families and ignoring *relational health* are getting it wrong.
- Childhood interactions affect language skills, social skills and set the trajectory of life.
- Traumatized kids with high ACE score have significant future troubles (in mind and body).
- Role of primary care giver is extremely important in the first 5 years of kid (brain structurally completes growing 95% unlike body!).
- Failing in primary care role results in self absorbed, immature kids in adults body, who needs inhumane clever kids in adults body!

Why we learn so much from previous generations unlike other animals!?
[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-07-220107.png]]

We pass on things to next generation
- models for problem solving (eg: violence/domination etc.)
- racism etc.

*INTENTIONALLY* we can do great good by passing on good things and cut out bad things!

- fun example, grandma's recipe, family holiday rituals

- Concept of nuclear family and private space is very new (99.98% of human history was not like that, they all lived with many families together)

- more touch, more contact, multi family group is ideal!
  4:1 (4 adults for each kid!)

*** Interactions with kid in normal home vs foster care! Poverty of Reward!

*Normal home* lot of positive, reinforcing, physiology regulating hugs/touches interaction. They provide positive rewards. On the absence of positive rewards kid turn to unhealthy snacks, smoking and other addictions!

*Foster care* Very small amount of loving interaction! :(

**** Shocker #1 (28:27 mins)

The amount of face-to-face interactions a modern kid at 15 with TV/Laptop/Screens have is roughly same as the face-to-face interactions a 6 year old enjoyed 30 years ago!

This results in 18 year olds with emotional skills of 6 year olds!
- i.e more self centered (posting too many photos in social media)
- self absorbed
- no emotional regulation

**** from 1938 to 2007, 5 times more kids scored for psychopathy!

Intrinsic goals: community, meaning in life and affiliation

Extrinsic goals: materialism and status

The shift has been from Intrinsic values to Extrinsic values.

**** Empathic Concerns and drop in perspective taking.

*** (ACE) Adverse Childhood Experience Score & HEALTH IMPACT

[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-07-231907.png]]

Bad effects of high ACE score is worse than having 2 packs of cigarette everyday!

*** Relationship protects you from adversity!

*** Hunter-gatherer is better parent than modern parents!

Even mother Teresa can't help, we need more relationship wealth for kid!

*** ROI of investments across all ages.
