* My Takeaways

*If a kid doesn't see light for first 5 years, all its visual circuit development stops and it's blind for life even with perfect eyes, SO IS EMOTIONAL/ATTENTION/IMPULSE REGULATION/STRESS REGULATION circuits (oxytocin, serotonin, dopamine, endorphin circuits).*

- Cognition stands on the edifice of emotions (in emotional brain)
- All 9 key functions of higher brain (Prefrontal cortex) is supported by mindfulness/meditation and 7 of them are nurtured from parenting!
  - Mindfulness/Meditation is important
- Short term stress adaptation (eg: dissociation) for survival in development has huge future cost in learning, behavior, social relationships and longevity.
- Stressed parenting is the problem (not really parents are bad)
- Kids hyper-texting each other is not technological problem its attachment problem (they have no adults emotionally attached)!

*Parents ROLE: To be a calm, non depressed, non stressful, emotionally present, attuned parent*

The opposite of above is bad (impulsive, sad, emotionally absent, non caring, abusive traumatizing children).

at 23:00 mins:

    The architecture of brain is constructed through an ongoing process
    that begins before birth, continues into adulthood and establishes a
    sturdy or fragile foundatation to ALL THE HEALTH, learning and
    behaviour that follow.

    The interaction of genes/experiences literally shapes the circuitary
    of the developing the brain and is criticially enforced by the mutual
    responsiveness of adult-child relationship particularly early
    childhood years.

    Adults get frustrated about kids behaviour and says "I have repeated
    this 1000 times not to do something, still kid is repeating it"
    well, who is having learning problem here!!!!

    (i.e parents are repeating ineffective way of discipling and not
    learning from their own in-your-face-ineffectiveness but tries to
    make the kid to learn something without understanding how learning works.
    hint: Learning starts when people are NOT emotionally shutdown)

* Talk Summary | How emotions affects our cognitive functioning
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYvxlkCGmbQ][Gabor Mate - How emotions affects our cognitive functioning - YouTube]]

9 yr old Kid with asperger (socially awkward and have an all-absorbing interest in specific topics) got handcuffed by police
thrown into isolation as punishment => WRONG, he needs opposite of this to handle his hyperactivity.


*9 important functions of mammalian PRE-FRONTOL-CORTEX*

1. Regulates body
2. Regulates attuned communication with others
3. Responsible for emotional balance
4. Allows flexibility in response (eg: animals scream/attack back automatically on threat, humans can take a moment, take other point of view, understand others pain/expectation, consequences, principles etc. and then pick appropriate response)
5. Providing insight
6. Providing empathy
7. Modulation of fear (prevents fear completely taking down the system in panic)
8. Intuition and
9. Morality

In the above list 7 of them are nurtured by parenting! A mindfulness practice nurtures all the above 9!


- PRENATAL STRESS - Stress during pregnancy precedes autism/learning problems/addiction problems later in life.
- Dissociation/Tuning out - is survival mechanism.
  - Shutting down emotionally as response for negative events STOPS learning and growth.
  - Being vulnerable is part of learning (every animal/plant starts soft and vulnerable)
  - Without learning, the developmental problems repeat => screwed for life with immature responses.
- Detachment from threatening relationship (another stress response):
  - kids detach from knowledgeable/mature adults and attaches to immature peers.
  - Learning stops.

*THREE MODES TO RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENT*

#+BEGIN_SRC
    | Fundamental - Reptilion mode     | Brain Stem             | we share with cold blooded animals   |
    | (Good for fish)                  |                        | on threat, they can't spend more     |
    |                                  |                        | energy, so they just freeze          |
    | NO LEARNING                      |                        | Just float under water and conserve  |
    | Life on autopilot.               |                        | oxygen!                              |
    |----------------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
    | Defensive - Mammalian mode       | Sympathetic            | Flight or Fight response, we share   |
    | (Good for rat)                   | Nerve System           | with all mammals                     |
    |                                  |                        |                                      |
    | NO/CRUDE/BASIC LEARNING          | (Adrenaline, cortisol, | Needs more sugar and blood to brain! |
    | Life LARGELY on autopilot.       | Dopamine, oxytocin,    |                                      |
    | (Remembers pain/pleasure)        | Sertonin etc.)         |                                      |
    |----------------------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
    | Growth -  Social Engagement mode |                        |                                      |
    | (Good for humans)                |                        | when humans use fish/rat             |
    |                                  |                        | responses, that's extremely          |
    | TRUE LEARNING STARTS!            |                        | ineffective in human mode of         |
    | Mindfulness, Decision making     |                        | survival (which builds on learning   |
    | Virtues, Problem solving,        |                        | extrospection/introspection as core  |
    | Insights, Compassion,            |                        | capability)                          |
    | Wisdom etc.all happens here!     |                        |                                      |

Relative to other primates, humans exhibit a great variety of singular cognitive abilities
for language, mathematics, music, tool use, theory of mind, and self- consciousness.
