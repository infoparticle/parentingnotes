* My Takeaways

- Behaviorism (the dominant paradigm) is completely flawed and is a dangerous short term working solution but screws up big in long term!
- Behaviorism (controller-controllee / WIN-LOSE)
  - shuts down learning and introspection
  - severs the connection between intrinsic motivation, values and self initiated actions.
  - screws up the ability to effectively communicate needs in mutually respectful ways and encourages manipulative or shaming/guilt as tools to meet one's need.
  - removes the chance of genuine happiness and satisfaction derived from intrinsically-motivated-self-initiated actions.
  - screws up the self-concept of kid.
  - enables toxic self image filled with unearned guilt and shame.
  - the negative reinforcement often relies on shaming and guilt tripping making the relationship extremely painful and toxic.
  - screws up the chance mutually respectful, enjoyable, genuine relationships.
- Alternate for behaviorism:
  - Based on mutual respect and freedom, WIN-WIN mindset.
  - Encourage learning, non controlling communication, self initiated actions.
  - Build better self-concept which is free from shame/guilt/manipulation etc.

#+BEGIN_SRC
Human beings can relate to one-another either
a) with mutual respect and freedom (which is good)
b) or mutual attempt to control and force (bribery, slavery, threats, manipulation).

why we choose option b for young human beings we call as children!?
#+END_SRC


* check your premises!


- premise 1. Controlled children grow into free adults!
- premise 2. There is no option to deal with children except to control them.

Are they really true !? Both are wrong (sorry Tiger moms, strict stern dads)!

*Behaviorism:* Reward favorable behaviour, Punish unfavorable behaviour.

what's wrong with above paradigm, although it does deliver rewards (every animal trainer knows this)!

#+BEGIN_SRC
..absolutely we can manipulate, coerse the children to produce desired behaviours
but what we can't do is, make them geniuenly happy!

You can give children prozac but can't make them geniuenly happy.

... UNLESS THE GOAL IS SELF INITIATED BY CHILD, THE CHILD NEVER FEELS HAPPY ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT.

** Behaviorism - Seeing humans as trainable lab rats.

The core error of behaviorism is it misses the existence of consciousness.

It says: Humans don't make conscious decisions, victims of unconscious programming just respond to pain and pleasures.

| purpose     | Control               |
| Methodology | Reward and punishment |

***** Rewarding & Punishing in behaviorism : approving glance, disapproving glance :) (LOL!)

*** Why Behaviorism is flawed?

It assumes children are same as unconscious animals which live a deterministic lives driven by instincts and pleasure/pain mechanisms.

In contrast to animals,
- children have a 'self'
- basic and growing forms of 'reason'
- values, thoughts, concepts, judgments
- volition and purpose
- memory, independence
- self-esteem and free-will

*** behaviorism: Flaw #1: Wrong assertion: children are NOT rational just like lab rats

see animals vs children list. Simply raising child is NOT same as training a rat.

*** Behaviorism: Flaw #2 | severs the connection between child's value and its action, destroying intrinsic motivation

- behavior :: *actions* we take to meet needs i.e attain *values*

This severs the connection between child's value and its action and
'parents satisfaction' becomes value!

Parent not the reality that determines when the child will feel pain or pleasure!

*Social Metaphysics:*

Kid starts to live in the universe of people not the facts! The fitness to existence
becomes how he can manipulate, placate, impress 'powerful others'.
Impressing others becomes more important than the actual facts and reality.

eg: kid rejecting healthy food because his friends see it as uncool.
or an adult works to impress their peers and boss's approval without noticing
how his health is getting spoiled. etc.

The kid setups to understand and conquer 'people' instead of understanding reality.
eg: people interested in reality shows rather than philosophy books.

This switch in metaphysical orientation completes with in 5 years of kids!


#+BEGIN_SRC
A healthy self motivated child:

    Motivated by self interested pursuit of values, seeking personal
    satisfaction derived from self initiated achievements.
#+END_SRC

Extrinsic motivators beget collectivism!
The method is message.

*Extrospection:*
1) What do i Know?
2) How do i know?

*Introspection:*
1) what do I feel?
2) why do I feel so?

*Role of parent is help children exercise both extrospection and introspection to achieve an integrated mind!*

When introspection is banned in home and replaced with extrinsic reward/punishment plans => very bad!

You are not teaching *self control* but teaching *emotional repression* and screwing up kids integrated mind development!

Eg: A 25 yr old end up not knowing what intrinsically motivates them (getting a degree what parents told, wasting time on a job instead of building career he likes etc.)!

Extrinsically rewarded kids do well only when they are being watched (create visibility in corporate lingo!)

*** controller-controlee relationship - seeds of collectivism

In controller-controlee relationship there is no respect or freedom!

Messes with the integrity of relationship, we hide the control-agenda to the kid.
Instead of 'being' with them we deploy the agenda!

i.e the claps (or spanking) you do is not really appreciation of kid as it is... but
a manipulative move to get your behavior goals done.

Any grownup adult will hate this  type of treatment but some how, we do this to our kids all the time!

Any form of duty removes the joy and makes it a never ending chore, the dutiful dad may start resenting his
*Slave Drivers*

A respectful relationship requires:
- presence
- self awareness, visibility, honesty, integrity
- interacting with reality (internal and external)

In an individualistic house hold, stages 3 & 4 can be skipped and stage 5-6 can be reached directly!
Majority of the society gets stuck at stage 3 & 4.


* debunking premise 2. There is no option to deal with children except to control them.

Controlling destroys the only thing you have with kid: relationship.

The alternative is mutual respect.

skills needed: communicating to emotional people

- In the paradigm of control: employee - employer are always in adversarial roles. Its WIN-LOSE
- *solution:* mutually respecting traders, its WIN-WIN

mindset of non controlling parent:
- Kid is respectful guest from different culture (not an idiot)
- Parent is the ambassador to parent's culture and slowly invites the baby into parents culture!

This is what I (parent) want, this is what our guest (kid) wants, what can we do to meet both our needs!
No one is trying to control, so there is no fear or resentment in the relationship, except lot of presence/being, honesty and marvel!

From this lens there is no 'defiant' baby, baby cries and simply expresses its frustration and need, thats all.
Parent completely *validates and respects* the childs frustration and tries to resolve the frustration by
helping the kid (in non controlling, non manipulative) by inviting it into parents culture.

*Psychological Economics: You can't give what you don't have!*
So be a hero and role model first instead of empty lectures!

*Self concept of itself, is the baby's destiny*

Parents role is build this self concept:
i.e baby is capable individual, who can take charge, solve his problems and be self driven (intrinsic values).

Help the kid to grow without TOXIC guilt/shame (typically comes from negative reinforcement of behaviorists!) as part of their self image.

Not having the above self concept opens the poor kid to life long
manipulation, being lost in external values (fancy cars, others
approval) and becoming clueless on what/how his internal emotions work.
A stunted mind that is not fully integrated.

* Note on Roslyn

Although she has lot of valid ideas. She view Buddhist non-attachment as 'ultimate ninja move of emotional repression' which is not correct!
