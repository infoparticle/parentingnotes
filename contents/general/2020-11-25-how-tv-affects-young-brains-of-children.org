* My Takeaways
- Absolutely NO need of TV for babies < 2 yrs old (recommendation of Pediatricians)
  - small babies stare at TV because of orientation response (not because they understand)
  - Baby videos (eg: Baby einstein) all are bullshit.
  - if a child watches 2 hrs a day, he will have 20% more likely to have attention problems compared to normal child.
  - To stimulate baby brain: Interact with it, talk with, creative play (encourages fine motor control, language skills etc.)
- TV messes up with Attention/Focus/Language circuits of *extremely fast developing brains*
- Content of TV matters, switch to slow paced, cognitively stimulating contents.
- Ditch TV, replace it with cooking/walking/books/face-time/outing etc.

*3 Type of action that forms strong base for baby's brain development:*
1. Bonding with other humans
2. Manipulating physical environment
3. Open ended problem solving creative type of plays.

***** Brain weight over lifespan

***** Role of synapses of connecting in early life

Mind is fine-tuned to early experience.

Early language exposure matters. If kids are not exposed to early language sounds they will never sound like natives later on!


[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-073406.png]]

******* snyapses connecting and pruning


[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-073714.png]]

***** breathing pattern and music

Even in one day baby sound changes the baby physiology.
[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-073745.png]]

***** PET scan - cared child vs neglected child

Too little stimulation is also bad.
(PET - Positron emission tomography)

***** 1970 kids vs current kids

- 1970 - kids started watching TV on their 4th year, today it's 4 months.
- Typical child watches 4.5 hrs or 40% of their waking hours!
[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-074046.png]]

***** baby einstein

The video content is too fast paced, it jumps all over the place
some baby einstein teaching videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFQoPelT74U

[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-074244.png]]

Over stimulation through TV brings attentional problem in later life.
[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-074540.png]]

***** cognitive stimulation VS TV stimulation

every hour kids watch the chances of problem increase by 10%
- if a child watches 2 hrs a day, he will have 20% more likely to have attention problems compared to normal child.

[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-074636.png]]
Cognitive stimulation:
- How often they are read to them, sing to them, going out to museum etc.
- Every hour of cognitive stimulation reduces the chance of attention problems by 30%


[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-074907.png]]

***** Contents of the video matters.

- content #1: Power puff girls cartoon (rapidly changing, loud noise, extremely stimulating)
- content #2: Mister Rogers (an old man explaining etiquette in hotel, no animation, very slow paced, old man slowly explaining things)


[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-080304.png]]

***** Mouse Experiment

Overstimulated rats spends more time in middle of the room, overriding its protective instincts to stay around corners.
Overstimulated rats show higher risky behavior (i.e failing to avoid room center) than it's normal peers.

- Normal mice: spends 75% more time on novel object - Good working memory and learning
- Hyperstimulated: treats both same  - Impaired learning and memory
[[file:./.imgs/2020-11-25-how-tv-affects-young-brains-of-children/2020-11-25-080632.png]]
***** Block Play

Kids playing with blocks along with parents, show better language development
than the ones that don't play with parents+blocks.

*** Talk #2: How To Stop Watching TV - Why You Must Eliminate TV Right Now!

***** Leo's youtube talk

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIIUg7WjGKA][How To Stop Watching TV - Why You Must Eliminate TV Right Now! - YouTube]]

- TV is fully based on SHOCK Value, built around ADVERTISEMENT.
- Tilts the world as negative place.
- Brain numbing, easy to plugin and be lazy (starting a business vs getting plugged into TV)
- Removes discretionary precious time that can be
- Ads: mind numbing, group think, think like mass
- Life purpose is gone (Contribution to world/you/family)
- Drains *WILL POWER*
- Even youtube can turn into low conscious

CUT OUT CABLE TV!

*Some Okay media consumption*

- DVDs okay for movies, great for educational content but NETFLIX/HULU/AMAZON Prime all are *WILL POWER* drainers.
- Youtube good for lectures, cognitively stimulating contents (Cut cat/porn/tick-tock crap)

*Stupid Excuses*
- Relaxes me and recharges my battery after long day of work. (The same is true for junk foods)

*With drawl Symptoms and some solutions!*

- Replace TV with something good, that can unwind, relax and re-charge.
  - may be a long walk, non-fiction books, audio programs, educational youtube videos, meditation.
  - YOU CAN NAP (excellent, awesome thing todo!)
  - cooking/nutrition
  - play with kids/dogs.
  - gym.
  - meet friends/people/family (you can even learn/share few things)


*** Talk #3: Effects of TV on Young Children

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaR48W_BlsA][Effects of Television On Young Children - Youtube]]


| Normal Development | Milestones                         |
|--------------------+------------------------------------|
| by 3 yrs           | talks in short sentences           |
| by 4 yrs           | talks in full sentences            |
|                    | Motor skills: climb/jump/play well |
|                    |                                    |

Limit the screen time.

ZERO TV till 2 years.

5 months old watching more than hour of TV every day.

by age 4, some kids watch 3 to 4 hours every day.

Sitting in front of screen makes them passive.

PASSIVITY = DELAYED LEARNING AND GROWTH in Attention and Language skills

Kids should crawl based on visual input and explore, this helps development later in reading.

NO TV until 3.

Max 1 hour later (with selected contents eg: NOT fast paced violence but slow educational videos).

Families with background TV on say 200 words per day.
When TV is off, its 1000 words per day exchanged with kid!

Kids need 3D objects to explore and learn NOT 2D screens where ball comes and vanishes.

Kids mimic and act out violent shows (eg: Ninja turtles)

Do you want to have TV in your house? Absolutely NOT.

In case if you have to watch, watch together with family and explain the consequences of adult contents (violence/sex) which is not shown.

It's better for kid to crawl and bang around pots and pans then sit in front of TV.

*** Talk #4: How young is too young to watch television?

Orienting response: Reflex that helps to protect us. Young babies watch TV just like it watches cobra near it.
They are not learning or absorbing the content.

- Michael Rich, MD, MPH

*3 Type of action that forms strong base for brain development:*
1. Bonding with other humans
2. Manipulating physical environment
3. Open ended problem solving creative type of plays.

We don't get any of the above from TV/Screens.

Baby videos are bullshit, no evidence of its effectiveness. In fact research show baby videos delay language development.

- Music
- Books (great for bonding with kids too!)

TV is dessert not the meal. Meal is time with family/sleep/homework.
No TV during family lunch/dinner and No TV in kids bedroom.
