* Main Idea of Ferber Method.

- It's okay for babies to cry and go to sleep but based on Ferber-Sleep Protocol.
- Main Idea:
  - After making sure the baby is fully fed, diapers changed, no bodily pain (fever/cough etc) are not there.
  - Start with 2 mins allow baby to cry, self sooth and sleep, don't engage with it, leave it alone.
  - Next extend this 2 mins to 5, 10, 15 etc.
- *CAUTION* This method is not for < 3 months babies. Baby's age and temperament should be considered.
